# Brain Tumor Detection using YOLOv8 on MRI Images

This project leverages the YOLOv8 object detection framework to identify brain tumors in MRI images. The goal is to provide an automated tool that assists in the early detection of brain tumors, thereby supporting clinical decision-making.

## Overview

Brain tumors are critical medical conditions that require timely detection. In this project, a deep learning approach using YOLOv8 is implemented to detect and localize tumors in MRI scans. The model is trained on annotated MRI images, and detection results are visualized directly in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure

- **brain-tumor-mri-yolov8.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **/data/**: Folder for storing MRI images and corresponding annotations.
- **/models/**: Directory where trained model weights and checkpoints are saved.
- **/results/**: Folder for saving output images with detection overlays and evaluation metrics.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-mri-yolov8.git
   cd brain-tumor-mri-yolov8
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, you may need to install packages such as `torch`, `opencv-python`, `ultralytics`, and others based on the notebook’s requirements.*

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset:**
   - Place your MRI images and annotations in the `/data/` directory.
   - Update any paths in the notebook (`brain-tumor-mri-yolov8.ipynb`) as needed.

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook brain-tumor-mri-yolov8.ipynb
     ```
   - Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the YOLOv8 model, and evaluate detection results.

3. **Review Results:**
   - Detection outputs and evaluation metrics will be displayed within the notebook.
   - Processed images with bounding boxes highlighting detected tumors will be saved in the `/results/` folder.

## Dataset

This project uses MRI datasets annotated for the presence of brain tumors. Two main sources have been utilized:

- **Roboflow Dataset:**  
  [Brain Tumor MRI](https://universe.roboflow.com/workspace-4c3re/brain-tumor-mri-bczdy)  
  Provides a collection of MRI images with annotations for tumor regions.

- **Kaggle Dataset:**  
  [MRI for Brain Tumor with Bounding Boxes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedsorour1/mri-for-brain-tumor-with-bounding-boxes)  
  A converted dataset from Kaggle, offering additional annotated images for training.

Annotations for tumor regions are provided for each image. Preprocessing steps include normalization and resizing as part of the notebook pipeline.

## Results

The notebook includes visualizations of the model’s performance, showing:
- Bounding box predictions overlaid on MRI images.
- Performance metrics such as precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision).

These results provide insights into the detection capabilities of YOLOv8 when applied to brain tumor identification.

## Future Work

Potential improvements for this project include:
- **Dataset Expansion:** Incorporating more annotated images to improve model robustness.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experimenting with different model configurations to optimize detection performance.
- **Clinical Validation:** Collaborating with medical professionals to validate the model on clinical data.
- **Integration:** Developing a user-friendly application or API for real-time tumor detection.
